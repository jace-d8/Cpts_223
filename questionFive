This main issue with the design of this program was the various logic errors. These combined with some
other poor coding standards compile the following:
1. size() returned size + 1 meaning isFull() and isEmpty() worked but responded to different intended maximums
2. queue class was originally placed in main.cpp, a queue.h and queue.cpp can lead to more organized and readable code
3. Functions such as peek() and isEmpty() were not marked as const even though they did not change the state
of the queue
4. Although it does not break the code, the destructor deletes the array incorrectly, it should be delete[] arr
as it is an array however it only uses keyword delete.
5. The naming convention "queue" matches the std::queue which is typically advised against, a name like Queue, or
my_queue, is more conventional.
